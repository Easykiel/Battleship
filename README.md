# Battleship

A simple battleship game complete with three types of AI: Random, Smart, Cheating.

The random AI simply chooses a random location on the board. 

The cheating AI knows the location of all of the ships and will fire at them until it wins. 

The smart AI first starts off as the random AI, but once it hits a targer it will look at the adjacent spaces to find the location of the rest of the ship.
